### I created an account on Docker Hub following the video's instructions. For simplicity, I used the same repo name as shown in the example.

### Using CloudShell, I opened a preview of the webpage with the image that would be uploaded into my Docker repo.

### After playing around with the different template styles, I was able to load the new web preview

### One of the issues that I encountered was entering the password for my Docker Hub login in the Cloudshell terminal. This has previously been an issue for me when trying to push files into an external repository. Typically, I would just switch over to Github codespaces or open a Google Colab notebook, to avoid the issue. 
### I've changed the copy-and-paste settings in the terminal settings and edited the terminal keyboard functions, but nothing seemed to work. I ended up using the login browser extension option, which only required entering the authentication code that the Cloudshell terminal provided.

### Once I was able to log in, the image was uploaded into my Docker repo.

### The GCP container was created following the instructions in the class example and connected to the Docker repo.

### Once everything was finished, I was able to click on the URL and open the webpage on GCP.
