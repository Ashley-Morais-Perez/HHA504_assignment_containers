I was also able to open the web preview from the example template

After playing around with the different template syles, I was able to load the new web preview

One of the issues I have with cloudshell is entering the password for things. It did work at one point but when I tried to login to Docker Hub manually via user and password, I wasn't able to type or Ctrl+ V the password. I ended up using the login browser extension option, which worked.

The URL also worked! While exploring template styles, I also found a feature that turns from black-and-white to color when you hover over the image. The feature still worked in the new URL.
